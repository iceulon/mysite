            <h2>Almost every company, firm, and designer has their own
            process for creating websites. Let's delve into some of
            these processes.</h2>

            a book by Kelly Goto and Emily Colter, describes what they 
            call the &ldquo;Core Process.&rdquo; This has five main steps:</h3> 
            <ol>
                <li>Define the project.</li>
                <li>Develop site structure.</li>
                <li>Design visual interface.</li>
                <li>Build and integrate.</li>
                <li>Launch and beyond.</li>
            </ol>
            <aside>There are other processes that web designers use. In an
            interview on the website &ldquo;<a href="http://www.wise-women.org/features/kelly_goto" title="wise-women.org Kelly Goto Interview">wise-women.org</a>,&rdquo; Kelly stated, &ldquo;Web Redesign 2.0: Workflow that Works is actually touted as a &lsquo;one process fits all.&rsquo; However this might be misleading to some; even I don&rsquo;t believe you can have one
            methodology to fit all types of projects.&rdquo;</aside>

                <ol>
                    <li>Gather the content.</li>
                    <li>Work with wireframes to organize and present that content.</li>
                    <li>Create static designs to demonstrate creative concepts and layout ideas.</li>
                    <li>Write meaningful markup that structures content.</li>
                    <li>Work with CSS to implement the design.</li>
                </ol>
